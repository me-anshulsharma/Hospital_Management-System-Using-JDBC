# Hospital Management System

## Overview

The `HospitalManagementSystem` Java program is designed to manage hospital operations, including adding patients, viewing patient and doctor information, booking appointments, and tracking billing. The program uses a MySQL database to store and retrieve data and interacts with the user through a command-line interface.

## Features

1. **Add Patient**: Allows the user to add new patient information to the database.
2. **View Patients**: Displays a list of all patients stored in the database.
3. **View Doctors**: Displays a list of all doctors stored in the database.
4. **Book Appointment**: Books an appointment between a patient and a doctor, checking for the doctorâ€™s availability and recording billing information.
5. **View Appointments**: Lists all scheduled appointments.
6. **Total Amount Collected**: Calculates the total amount collected from appointments on a specific date.
7. **Exit**: Exits the application.

  - `getFeeForDoctor(int doctorId, Connection connection)`: Retrieves the consultation fee for a doctor based on their specialization.
  - `recordBilling(int appointmentId, String incomeDate, double amount, Connection connection)`: Records the billing information for an appointment.
  - `viewAppointments(Connection connection)`: Displays all scheduled appointments.
  - `checkTotalAmountCollected(Connection connection, Scanner scanner)`: Calculates the total amount collected on a specific date.

### `Doctor`
- **Attributes**:
  - `connection`: Database connection object.
- **Methods**:

  - `viewDoctors()`: Displays all doctors stored in the database.
  - `getDoctorById(int id)`: Checks if a doctor exists in the database by their ID.
  - `getFeeForSpecialization(String specialization)`: Returns the consultation fee based on the doctor's specialization.

### `Patient`
- **Attributes**:
  - `connection`: Database connection object.
  - `scanner`: Scanner object for user input.
- **Methods**:
  - `Patient(Connection connection, Scanner scanner)`: Constructor that initializes the database connection and scanner.
  - `addPatient()`: Adds a new patient to the database.
  - `viewPatients()`: Displays all patients stored in the database.
